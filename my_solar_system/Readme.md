# Solar System Simulation

This project is a visually-pleasing simulation of the solar system, written using only HTML and CSS. It features each of the eight planets in our solar system, along with a fictional dwarf planet. Each planet is orbiting in a elliptical path around the sun with different speeds to give a feel of actual Solar System.
